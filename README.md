## Contributing

This repository serves as a laboratory for cutting edge snippets that may be merged into [Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate).

Feel free to make a pull request.

Do refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/issues/19) for more details.

## Safety

This is **experimental software** and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

We **do not give any warranties** and **will not be liable for any loss** incurred through any use of this codebase.

While Solady has been heavily tested, there may be parts that may exhibit unexpected emergent behavior when used with other code, or may break in future Solidity versions.  

Please always include your own thorough tests when using Solady to make sure it works correctly with your code.  

## Upgradability

Most contracts in Solady are compatible with both upgradeable and non-upgradeable (i.e. regular) contracts. 

Please call any required internal initialization methods accordingly.

## EVM Compatibility

Some parts of Solady may not be compatible with chains with partial EVM equivalence.

Please always check and test for compatibility accordingly.
