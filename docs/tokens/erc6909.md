# ERC6909

Simple EIP-6909 implementation.


<b>Note:</b>

The ERC6909 standard allows minting and transferring to and from the zero address,
minting and transferring zero tokens, as well as self-approvals.
For performance, this implementation WILL NOT revert for such actions.
Please add any checks with overrides if desired.

<b>If you are overriding:</b>
- Make sure all variables written to storage are properly cleaned
//    (e.g. the bool value for `isOperator` MUST be either 1 or 0 under the hood).
- Check that the overridden function is actually used in the function you want to
change the behavior of. Much of the code has been manually inlined for performance.

## Custom Errors

### InsufficientBalance()

```solidity
error InsufficientBalance()
```

Insufficient balance.

### InsufficientPermission()

```solidity
error InsufficientPermission()
```

Insufficient permission to perform the action.

### BalanceOverflow()

```solidity
error BalanceOverflow()
```

The balance has overflowed.

## ERC6909 Metadata

### tokenURI(uint256)

```solidity
function tokenURI(uint256 id) public view virtual returns (string memory);
```

Returns the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for token `id`.

## ERC6909

### balanceOf(address,uint256)

```solidity
function balanceOf(address owner, uint256 id)
    public
    view
    virtual
    returns (uint256 amount)
```

Returns the amount of token `id` owned by `owner`.

### allowance(address,address,uint256)

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 id)
    public
    view
    virtual
    returns (uint256 amount)
```

Returns the amount of token `id` that `spender` can spend on behalf of `owner`.

### isOperator(address,address)

```solidity
function isOperator(address owner, address spender)
    public
    view
    virtual
    returns (bool status)
```

Checks if a `spender` is approved by `owner` to manage all of their tokens.

### transfer(address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount)
    public
    payable
    virtual
    returns (bool)
```

Transfers `amount` of token `id` from the caller to `to`.   
Requirements:   
- caller must at least have `amount`.   
Emits a {Transfer} event.

### transferFrom(address,address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount)
    public
    payable
    virtual
    returns (bool)
```

Transfers `amount` of token `id` from `from` to `to`.   
Note: Does not update the allowance if it is the maximum uint256 value.   
Requirements:   
- `from` must at least have `amount` of token `id`.   
-  The caller must have at least `amount` of allowance to transfer the   
   tokens of `from` or approved as an operator.   
Emits a {Transfer} event.

### approve(address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 id, uint256 amount)
    public
    payable
    virtual
    returns (bool)
```

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` for the caller for token `id`.   
Emits a {Approval} event.

### setOperator(address,bool)

```solidity
function setOperator(address operator, bool approved)
    public
    payable
    virtual
    returns (bool)
```

Sets whether `operator` is approved to manage the tokens of the caller.   
Emits {OperatorSet} event.

### supportsInterface(bytes4)

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    public
    view
    virtual
    returns (bool result)
```

Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by `interfaceId`.

## Internal Functions

### _mint(address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

Mints `amount` of token `id` to `to`.   
Emits a {Transfer} event.

### _burn(address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function _burn(address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

Burns `amount` token `id` from `from`.   
Emits a {Transfer} event.

### _transfer(address,address,address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function _transfer(
    address by,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual
```

Transfers `amount` of token `id` from `from` to `to`.   
Note: Does not update the allowance if it is the maximum uint256 value.   
Requirements:   
- `from` must at least have `amount` of token `id`.   
- If `by` is not the zero address,   
  it must have at least `amount` of allowance to transfer the   
  tokens of `from` or approved as an operator.   
Emits a {Transfer} event.

### _approve(address,address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function _approve(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual
```

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` for `owner` for token `id`.   
Emits a {Approval} event.

### _setOperator(address,address,bool)

```solidity
function _setOperator(address owner, address operator, bool approved)
    internal
    virtual
```

Sets whether `operator` is approved to manage the tokens of `owner`.   
Emits {OperatorSet} event.

## Hooks To Override

### _beforeTokenTransfer(address,address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual
```

Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens.   
This includes minting and burning.

### _afterTokenTransfer(address,address,uint256,uint256)

```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual
```

Hook that is called after any transfer of tokens.   
This includes minting and burning.
