# ERC1155

Simple ERC1155 implementation.


<b>Note:</b>

- The ERC1155 standard allows for self-approvals.
For performance, this implementation WILL NOT revert for such actions.
Please add any checks with overrides if desired.
- The transfer functions use the identity precompile (0x4)
to copy memory internally.

<b>If you are overriding:</b>
- Make sure all variables written to storage are properly cleaned
//    (e.g. the bool value for `isApprovedForAll` MUST be either 1 or 0 under the hood).
- Check that the overridden function is actually used in the function you want to
change the behavior of. Much of the code has been manually inlined for performance.

## ERC1155 Metadata

### uri(uint256)

```solidity
function uri(uint256 id) public view virtual returns (string memory);
```

Returns the URI for token `id`.   
You can either return the same templated URI for all token IDs,   
(e.g. "https://example.com/api/{id}.json"),   
or return a unique URI for each `id`.

## Hooks For Overriding

### _useBeforeTokenTransfer()

```solidity
function _useBeforeTokenTransfer() internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

Override this function to return true if `_beforeTokenTransfer` is used.   
This is to help the compiler avoid producing dead bytecode.

### _beforeTokenTransfer(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual
```

Hook that is called before any token transfer.   
This includes minting and burning, as well as batched variants.   
The same hook is called on both single and batched variants.   
For single transfers, the length of the `id` and `amount` arrays are 1.

### _useAfterTokenTransfer()

```solidity
function _useAfterTokenTransfer() internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

Override this function to return true if `_afterTokenTransfer` is used.   
This is to help the compiler avoid producing dead bytecode.

### _afterTokenTransfer(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)

```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual
```

Hook that is called after any token transfer.   
This includes minting and burning, as well as batched variants.   
The same hook is called on both single and batched variants.   
For single transfers, the length of the `id` and `amount` arrays are 1.
