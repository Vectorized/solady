# ERC721

Simple ERC721 implementation with storage hitchhiking.


<b>Note:</b>

- The ERC721 standard allows for self-approvals.
For performance, this implementation WILL NOT revert for such actions.
Please add any checks with overrides if desired.
- For performance, methods are made payable where permitted by the ERC721 standard.
- The `safeTransfer` functions use the identity precompile (0x4)
to copy memory internally.

<b>If you are overriding:</b>
- NEVER violate the ERC721 invariant&#58;
the balance of an owner MUST always be equal to their number of ownership slots.
The transfer functions do not have an underflow guard for user token balances.
- Make sure all variables written to storage are properly cleaned
(e.g. the bool value for `isApprovedForAll` MUST be either 1 or 0 under the hood).
- Check that the overridden function is actually used in the function you want to
change the behavior of. Much of the code has been manually inlined for performance.
