## ETH Operations

If the ETH transfer MUST succeed with a reasonable gas budget, use the force variants.   
The regular variants:   
- Forwards all remaining gas to the target.   
- Reverts if the target reverts.   
- Reverts if the current contract has insufficient balance.   
The force variants:   
- Forwards with an optional gas stipend   
  (defaults to `GAS_STIPEND_NO_GRIEF`, which is sufficient for most cases).   
- If the target reverts, or if the gas stipend is exhausted,   
  creates a temporary contract to force send the ETH via `SELFDESTRUCT`.   
  Future compatible with `SENDALL`: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758.   
- Reverts if the current contract has insufficient balance.   
The try variants:   
- Forwards with a mandatory gas stipend.   
- Instead of reverting, returns whether the transfer succeeded.
